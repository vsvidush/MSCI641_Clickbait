Competition-Clickbait_Spoiling

This challenge contains 2 tasks, the first is the classification task and the second task is generating spoilers. 

For running code for task 2: Please follow the instruction given in the notebook. For task 2, each model is in a separate directory along with train and inference notebook files. All pre-trained models are uploaded to a private hugging face library which can be run by the private token mentioned in the inference file. Rest all instructions for running each file mentioned in individual notebook files.

For Clickbait Spoiler Classification and Generation task, two folders separately are attached individually for the respective task.


1.Update all the file paths with your location of dataset as well as the path of validation files.
2.The generative model tasks have two file one is the main code for training the model and the other one is Inference code for the Results.
3.Paths needs to get updated in both the files.
4.The Performance Validation file attached here also needs to get updated with the respective paths which is used to evaluate the Bleu score, Meteor Score
 and Rouge Score individually for all the generative task models
